The QR Luggage Tracker is a web application designed to help travelers easily recover lost luggage. Upon registering, users receive a unique QR code that can be attached to their luggage. If the luggage is lost and later found, anyone who scans the QR code can see the registered ownerâ€™s name and email, facilitating the return of the lost item.
